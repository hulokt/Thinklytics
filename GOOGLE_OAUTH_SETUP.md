# Google OAuth Setup - Implementation Summary

## What Was Added

Google Sign-In/Sign-Up functionality has been successfully integrated into your Thinklytics application.

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Added `signInWithGoogle()` method to AuthContext
- Configured OAuth redirect URL to work with your custom domain
- Added proper error handling for OAuth flow

### 2. `src/components/SignupPage.jsx`
- Added Google Sign-Up button with official Google branding
- Added "or" divider between email signup and Google signup
- Added loading states for Google authentication
- Integrated error display for Google signup failures

### 3. `src/components/LoginPage.jsx`
- Added Google Sign-In button with official Google branding
- Added "or" divider between email login and Google login
- Added loading states for Google authentication
- Integrated error display for Google login failures

## How It Works

1. **User clicks "Continue with Google"** on either Login or Signup page
2. **Application redirects to Google** for authentication
3. **User authorizes** the app with their Google account
4. **Google redirects back** to `https://thinklytics.org/auth/callback`
5. **App processes the OAuth callback** and creates/signs in the user
6. **User is redirected** to `/questions` page

## Features

- ✅ Beautiful, branded Google button with official colors
- ✅ Loading states during OAuth flow
- ✅ Error handling and display
- ✅ Works with custom domain (thinklytics.org)
- ✅ Prevents multiple simultaneous auth attempts
- ✅ Consistent with existing UI design (light/dark mode)

## Configuration Required in Supabase

Make sure you have configured in your Supabase dashboard:

1. **Authentication → Providers → Google**
   - Enable Google provider
   - Add your Client ID
   - Add your Client Secret
   - Set redirect URL: `https://thinklytics.org/auth/callback`

2. **Authentication → URL Configuration**
   - Site URL: `https://thinklytics.org`
   - Redirect URLs: `https://thinklytics.org/auth/callback`

## Testing

1. Run `npm run build && npm run deploy` to deploy changes
2. Visit https://thinklytics.org/login or /signup
3. Click "Continue with Google"
4. Sign in with Google account
5. Should redirect to /questions page

## User Experience

- First-time Google users will be automatically signed up
- Returning Google users will be signed in
- Google profile data (name, email) is automatically populated
- No email confirmation required for Google sign-ins
